# Frontend Changes Log - Admin Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented generic Admin User Management UI and User Profile page, along with authentication fixes.

## Key Changes
1. **UI Fixes**:
   - Updated `LoginForm.tsx` and `RegisterForm.tsx` to use black text instead of light gray for better visibility.

2. **Middleware**:
   - Created `middleware.ts` to protect `/admin` and `/user` routes. Redirects to login if no token is present. Checks for admin role in token.

3. **User Profile**:
   - Created `app/user/profile/page.tsx`:
     - Matches the provided mobile design.
     - Supports profile image upload and detail updates.
     - Uses `PUT /api/auth/:id`.

4. **Admin Pages**:
   - Created `app/admin/users/page.tsx`: User list table with images and roles.
   - Created `app/admin/users/create/page.tsx`: Form to create new users (Buyer/Seller/Admin) with image.
   - Created `app/admin/users/[id]/page.tsx`: Detail view of a user.
   - Created `app/admin/users/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Edit form for users.

## Dependencies
- No new NPM packages installed (used existing standard Next.js and React features).
