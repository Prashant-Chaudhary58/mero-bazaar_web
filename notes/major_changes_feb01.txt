# Major Changes - Feb 1, 2026

## 1. Hero & Header Redesign
- **Hero Section:** Reduced height for a sleeker look (`py-16` -> `py-10`).
- **Header:**
  - Added **Cart** and **Notification** icons for logged-in users.
  - Implemented conditional rendering: "Log in/Sign up" buttons hide when logged in.
  - Fixed duplicate navigation links and syntax errors.

## 2. Profile Image & User Updates
- **Frontend:**
  - Updated `ProfilePage` to allow uploading a profile image and editing details.
  - Connected to new backend routes.
- **Backend:**
  - Created new `routes/user_route.js` and `controllers/user_controller.js`.
  - Implemented `PUT /api/v1/users/:id` to handle file uploads and profile text updates.
  - Added support for updating `Buyer`, `Farmer`, and `User` collections dynamically.

## 3. Offline Capabilities & Persistence
- **Persistent Login:** 
  - The app now saves your user session to `localStorage`. 
  - You stay visually logged in even if the backend server restarts or goes down.
- **Offline Image Caching:**
  - Profile images are now converted to Base64 and cached locally.
  - **Benefit:** You can still see your profile picture even if the backend (which hosts the image) is not running.
- **Product Visibility:**
  - Products currently use static data, ensuring they remain visible offline by default.

## 4. Fixes
- Resolved `Unexpected token <` error by fixing missing `/me` and `/logout` API routes.
- Addressed Port 3000 conflict issues.
